### Project Overview
This is an interactive SVG-based game where players try to click on a moving circle to increase their score. The circle moves automatically at increasing speeds, and stars twinkle in the background for a visually appealing effect.

### Chosen Technology
- Topic: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

### References
- Based on SVG tutorial from [W3Schools - SVG](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp)
- Used Framer Motion for animations: [Framer Motion Docs](https://motion.dev/docs/react-quick-start)

### Features
- Dynamic Moving Circle: Moves automatically within the game boundaries at increasing speeds.
- Scoring System: Clicking the circle increases the score.
- Twinkling Stars: Fixed-position stars animate with a glowing effect.
- Animated Borders: Adds an engaging visual effect to the game.
- Optimized Code: Removed duplicate star elements using `.map()`, making it scalable and maintainable.

### How to Play
1. Click the moving circle before it changes position.
2. Each successful click increases your score.
3. The game gets harder over time as the circle speeds up.
